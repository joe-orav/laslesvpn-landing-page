# Lasles VPN Landing Page (Live Demo)

A live demo of a mock landing page.

The original design did not include tablet or mobile versions so I had to design that myself. I also made some grammatical changes as well.

This demo was made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript for the mobile menu view and testimonials section.

The live site can be accessed [here](https://laslesvpn-landing-page.vercel.app).

Credit for the design goes to [Didi Kurniawan](https://dribbble.com/shots/11356916-LaslesVPN).
